# Redux CRUD
A specialized functional factory to construct elemental CRUD operation's facilities for Redux implementations.

## Motivation
As most of Redux CRUD implementations created nowadays follow certain specific conventions, this package looks forward to encapsulate most of the boilerplate code generally written into easy/ready-to-use wrappers to add into your project.

## Code style
This project uses xo.js to follow general accepted conventions on code writing.

## Features
* Compliance with Redux conventions
* Easy-to-use
* Extensible
